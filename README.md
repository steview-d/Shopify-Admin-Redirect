# Shopify Admin Redirect Chrome Extension

A silly little extension that allows you to click a button when on a Shopify storefront `product`, `collection`, or `page` page and it will take you to the admin page.

## Installation

Download this repo into a folder.

From chrome, click the settings icon (top right - 3 little dots, stacked vertically) and then choose `Extensions` >> `Manage extensions`.

Enable `Developer Mode` by clicking the toggle in the upper right of the window.

Once active, you will see a `Load unpacked` option appear in the upper left.

Click it, and you will then be able to choose the folder you downloaded earlier.

The extension should now be active. You can click the little jigsaw icon in the upper right to select and pin it.

Now, when you click the Shopify icon when on a product, collection, or page template, the admin page for that resource will open in a new tab.
